# javascript-challenge

Here we have a website project that displays UFO sightings information in a table. 
Website currently not live, but this will run with a local html server 8000

I created several filter drop down lists to display subsets of data using Javascript, D3 and HTML. 

I attempted a multi-filter which sort of works, and was a bonus challenge for this activity
